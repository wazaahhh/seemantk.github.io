    This represents all the questions by all the users to date.
    The questions are initially laid out by category
        The grey wings are other users' questions
        The color-matched wings are "the me user" questions
    They strongly gravitate to being reverse-chronologically ordered by most recently active (voted on)
        Unchecking the checkbox releases the category trap, causing the questions to reach global equilibrium (reverse chron)
    The dropdown to "me" filters out all the not-my questions.  The same category lock/unlock mechanism works in this view as well.
