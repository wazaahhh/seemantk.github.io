Gentoo Linux activity since the first CVS commit in July 2000. To pause the activity you can either click the pause/stop button or click on a date (month or year). There will be a slight difference in the paused display depending on which you hit. The pause button literally pauses the action. The date strip shows the entire historical snapshot per the date clicked.
